# Story 2.1: Frontend Project Setup

**Epic:** Frontend Application (Next.js)

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript and a component library,
**so that** I have a foundational, version-controlled frontend structure ready for UI development.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1:** A new Next.js project is created using `create-next-app`.
2. **AC2:** The project is configured to use TypeScript.
3. **AC3:** A modern UI component library (e.g., **Material-UI (MUI)** or **Shadcn/ui**) is installed and configured.
4. **AC4:** The default Next.js boilerplate is replaced with a simple "Hello World" page that uses a component from the chosen UI library.
5. **AC5:** The project structure is organized to include directories for `components`, `pages`, `lib`, etc.
6. **AC6:** The project is committed to the Git repository in a new `frontend` directory (or similar, to separate it from the backend code).
7. **AC7:** A `README.md` file is created within the frontend project directory explaining how to install dependencies and run the local development server.

## Dev Notes

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Components**: Shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind)

### Build Issues
- `npm run build` is currently blocked by Windows Group Policy in this environment due to `next` or `esbuild` binaries. However, the code structure and dependencies are correctly initialized.

---

## Testing

- **Manual Verification**: Code review of `src/app/page.tsx` and component files.
- **Validation**: Tailwind and TypeScript configurations are present and standard.
