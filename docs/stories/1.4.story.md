# Story 1.4: Local Dev & Cloudflare Deployment Config (Ready for Review)

## 1. Context
We need to ensure the application is easily portable to other development environments and ready for its first deployment on Cloudflare Pages.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Improved `src/hooks.server.ts` to support local user mocking via environment variables.
- [x] Cloudflare Pages deployment script added to `package.json`.
- [x] Documentation for environment variables required for local vs. production setup.
- [x] Verification that the app can build for Cloudflare (`npm run build`).

## 3. Technical Notes
- Use SvelteKit's environment variable system.
- Use `adapter-cloudflare` for the build process.
- Create a template `.env.example` for the other computer.
